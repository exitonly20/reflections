How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	Diff shows the differences between the files. So, rather than manually
	examining each line, the differences show up fast.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Not afraid to break application trying experimental features.
	Revert to earlier version before a bug was introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Can commit when it makes sense logically.
	Commit when a feature has been completed.
	Commit when a bug has been fixed.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Git --> The files are related (they are used to run the same application).
	Google Docs --> The files are not related.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log --> shows a history of commits
	git diff --> ... not sure

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	Can always revert to a version before a bug was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I want to have fun learning Git.
