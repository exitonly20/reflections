What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

	1) ".git" file is added in directory
	2) there is NOT an automatic initial commit during initialization
	3) existing files are "Untracked files" and can be seen using "git status"

How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area allows multiple files to grouped together
	that are logically part of the same solution.
