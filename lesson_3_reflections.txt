When would you want to use a remote repository 
rather than keeping all your work local?

	When working with a team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?

	Don't want to push changes out until I'm ready
	for everyone else to see them.
